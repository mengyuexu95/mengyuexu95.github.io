  Optical modulators are at the heart of optical communication links. Ideally,
  they should feature low loss, low drive voltage, large bandwidth, high
  linearity, compact footprint and low manufacturing cost. Unfortunately, these
  criteria have been achieved only on separate occasions. Based on a silicon and
  lithium niobate hybrid integration platform, we demonstrate Mach–Zehnder
  modulators that simultaneously fulfil these criteria. The presented device
  exhibits an insertion loss of 2.5 dB, voltage–length product of 2.2 V cm in
  single-drive push–pull operation, high linearity, electro-optic bandwidth of
  at least 70 GHz and modulation rates up to 112 Gbit s<sup>-1</sup>. The high-performance
  modulator is realized by seamless integration of a high-contrast waveguide
  based on lithium niobate—a popular modulator material—with compact, low-loss
  silicon circuitry. The hybrid platform demonstrated here allows for the
  combination of ‘best-in-breed’ active and passive components, opening up new
  avenues for future high-speed, energy-efficient and cost-effective optical
  communication networks.
