  The coherent transmission technology using digital signal processing and
  advanced modulation formats, is bringing networks closer to the theoretical
  capacity limit of optical fibres, the Shannon limit. The in-phase/quadrature
  electro-optic modulator that encodes information on both the amplitude and the
  phase of light, is one of the underpinning devices for the coherent
  transmission technology. Ideally, such modulator should feature a low loss,
  low drive voltage, large bandwidth, low chirp and compact footprint. However,
  these requirements have been only met on separate occasions. Here, we
  demonstrate integrated thin-film lithium niobate in-phase/quadrature
  modulators that fulfil these requirements simultaneously. The presented
  devices exhibit greatly improved overall performance (half-wave voltage,
  bandwidth and optical loss) over traditional lithium niobate counterparts, and
  support modulation data rate up to 320 Gbit s−1. Our devices pave new routes
  for future high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective communication
  networks.
