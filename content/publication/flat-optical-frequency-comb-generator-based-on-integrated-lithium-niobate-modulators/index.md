  Chip-scale electro-optic (EO) frequency combs are expected to play an
  essential role in future high-capacity optical communications systems and
  next-generation mobile communications. The application requires integrated EO
  frequency comb generators featuring good spectral flatness, high modulation
  bandwidth, low driving voltage and low insertion loss simultaneously. Here, we
  demonstrate a flat-top optical flat comb (OFC) generator based on
  high-performance lithium niobate on insulator modulators. The OFC generator
  shows a low on-chip loss (2.1 dB), a low driving voltage over a broad
  frequency range, and a large 3-dB EO bandwidth. Moreover, with consuming power
  of less than 2W, the presented device produces 13 lines with a power variation
  of less than 1.2 dB and a line spacing of 31 GHz which can further be extended
  to 67 GHz.
