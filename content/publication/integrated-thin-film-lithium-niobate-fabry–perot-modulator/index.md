  Integrated traveling-wave lithium niobate modulators need relatively large
  device lengths to achieve low drive voltage. To increase modulation efficiency
  within a compact footprint, we report an integrated Fabry–Perot-type
  electro-optic thin film lithium niobate on insulator modulator comprising a
  phase modulation region sandwiched between two distributed Bragg reflectors.
  The device exhibits low optical loss and a high tuning efficiency of 15.7
  pm/V. We also confirm the modulator’s high-speed modulation performance by
  non-return-to-zero modulation with a data rate up to 56 Gbit/s.
