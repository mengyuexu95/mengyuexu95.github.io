abstract: >-
  We propose and demonstrate a polarizationinsensitive and high-speed optical
  switch unit based on a silicon and lithium niobate hybrid integration
  platform. The presented device exhibits a sub nano-second switching time, low
  drive voltages of less than 10 V, and low power dissipation due to
  electrostatic operation. The measured polarization dependence loss was lower
  than 0.8 dB. The demonstrated optical switch could provide a building block
  for polarization-insensitive and high-speed optical matrix switches.
