  Coherent technology has been employed in long-haul transmission systems in the
  past decade, with growing demand for capacity at ever-lower costs per bit.
  High-performance coherent modulators with high data rates, wide bandwidth,
  small footprint, and low power operation are highly desired. Toward this end,
  we propose a folded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) dual-polarization
  in-phase quadrature modulator featuring a low half-wave voltage of 1 V and a
  compact footprint of 4 × 8 mm<sup>2</sup>. To suppress RF wavefront distortion
  and optimize high-frequency electro-optic performance, we utilize air-bridge
  structures in the U-turns of the traveling-wave electrodes. As a demonstration
  of the long-haul transmission capacities with our device, we present
  driverless 703 Gb/s/λ line-rate transmissions, with a subcarrier modulation
  scheme, over a 1120 km single-mode fiber link. Here, for the first time, to
  our knowledge, our device allows for attojoule-per-bit level electrical energy
  consumption over transmission distances above 1000 km. The device opens
  opportunities for much lower-cost and capacity-intensive coherent systems that
  consume ultra-low power, support high data rate, and work in small spaces.
