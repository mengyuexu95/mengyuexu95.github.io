Throughout her Ph.D., Mengyue Xu concentrated her research on **thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN)** photonics and **heterogeneous Si/TFLN** photonics, particularly their applications in optical communication systems. She significantly contributed to the advancement of ultra-high-speed electro-optic **modulators** and efficient **optical frequency combs**, most notably the pioneering development of the first coherent modulator based on TFLN technology. Currently, she is engrossed in the exploration of quantum spin-acoustic interaction of color centers in diamond and silicon carbide.
